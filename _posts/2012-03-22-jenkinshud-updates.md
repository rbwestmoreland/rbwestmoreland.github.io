Since introducing [JenkinsHUD](https://github.com/rbwestmoreland/JenkinsHUD), a team oriented UI of [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) job statuses, I have been hard at work on providing additional features. I am happy to annouce the follow new features:  

* Filter jobs by views (the same ones you are using in your Jenkins instance)  
* Two ways to use JenkinsHUD  
  * Locally ([Download from Github](https://github.com/rbwestmoreland/JenkinsHUD))  
  * Online ([Try it out now!](http://rbwestmoreland.github.com/JenkinsHUD))
* Multiple UI improvements
